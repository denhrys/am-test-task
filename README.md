## Interview Task description
The provided URL returns JSON, which contains an array of objects representing rows. Each row has a field, columns, which contains an array of objects representing article previews. In effect, the provided JSON is a simplified representation of the Dagbladet front page. We would like you to create a React application that makes a request to the provided URL, and renders the rows and articles in accordance with the JSON response.
Each article should have an edit button which swaps out the title with an input field that allows the user to edit and save the title. In addition to the edit button, there should be a delete button that deletes the article. When an article is deleted, show a prompt for a few seconds that allows the user to restore the last deleted article.

## Additional Details
The following is an example of a row that appears in the response. The width is based on a 12-column grid. A width of 5, therefore, implies that this article should be 5/12ths of the body width. The other article has a width of 7, meaning it takes up the remaining 7/12ths of the body width. All rows will have a width that sums to 12.

For imageUrl, the height and width of the image can be modified by adding &height=X and/or &width=X to the URL. The other fields are hopefully self-explanatory.

##Bonus Task
Create two separate routes (or pages if you will), one that shows the full articles with images using the rows and columns grid explained in the JSON structure, and another route that only shows a simple one column list containing article titles. Make sure the browser does not download any unused JavaScript files on the given routes.
